In terms of computer science and information technology, it refers to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information. These are the three pillars of a secure information system.

The security realm of information processing refers to the use case where information is only presented to the person who is authorized to have it, while also making sure that it is presented in the original form (integrity), and is always available on-demand (availability).
