# Mathmatics
---
Studuying the mathematics used behind the computers. It starts from basic algebra to studing the nature of nuumbers, permutaions and combication, probability and statistics. In artificial interlligence we make use of linear algebra. But the core is the fundamental knowledge of Logic and sets.
