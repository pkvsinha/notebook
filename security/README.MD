# Security
---

Security is a notion of protecting something from unintentional access, preventing from damage and that it should be used only by the intended person in its original from. In terms of computer science and information technology, it refers to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information. These are the three pillars of a secure information system.

The security realm of information processing refers to the use case where information is only presented to the person who is authorized to have it, while also making sure that it is presented in the original form (integrity), and is always available on-demand (availability).

This bring into the picture lots of tools and mechanism required to achieve the CIA pillars - Authentication, Authorization etc. Of all the mechanisms used to support security, Cryptography lies at the heart. Be it a client trying to authenticate with the server, the information being sent should be encrypted.

We are trying to secure our system from anything which can compromise it confidentaility, integrity and availability. There are several tools employed to ensure a secure environemtn - passwords, firewalls, encryption etc. 

Although the purpose of security is to ensure all of the above, but most importantly the services offered should be hassle-free for the intended users. There are systems which uses variuso mechanism like SSO, OAuth to maintain security while offering the user the services without any overhead. 

## Authentication
Authentication is the process of identifying the claim of a client. There are several authentication mechanism like using user name and password, OpenId, Open.

## Authorization
It is mechanism to provide access to certain resource, while restricting others. There are various mechanisms devised to handle authorization from finer role/attribute based settings to coarser group based settings.

## Vulneberities
Vulenebrirites are gaps in the system which can be exploied to gain unauthorized access and may result in unprecendented losses because of data theft, service unavailability to name a few.

## Encryption
It is one of the most important tool specialized for the purpose of data integrity and confidentiality - even if the data falls in the wrong hands, encryption should make it impossible to access the information without the valid key. In these circumstances it becomes utterly importatnt that one should secure the keys.
