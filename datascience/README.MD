# Data Science Guide
---
Data science is the field of studying the nature and properties of data, how it can be organized and summarized that gives us the insights of it.

If we treat data as a collection, then studying the statistical behaior of it can give us cetain insights into it. Most of times we are normally interested in doing aggregrate operation, like sum, avaerga, min, max, count etc. They allow us to visualize cetain apects of the data. Further advanced analysis would require us more sophisticated tools and techniques to handle and understand the variety, pattern of data considering it size. 

So first thing is representation based on which ew can select tools to process them. Most oftenly data is stored in a data warehourse, like a SQL or NoSql database. Those times we would oftenly work with SQL. Other times we need to process data as streams like CSV/Excel file in which case programming environment libraries can come in handy like pythong or R.

Python is certainly the most favoured language by data enthusiasts. It comes with variety of library to handle data and perform statistical operations on it.
