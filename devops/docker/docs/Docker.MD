## Using Docker
The first step of using docker is to convert your application build into a docker build. Docker works around the concept similar to git, an image represents and application to run on docker. The way you do git pull or push same way docker works with central repository or registry where docker images can be push or from where docker images can pulled to create images on top of them.

At this point the only dependency that an application would need to provide is the network port and the file system usage.

## Network configurations

## File system configurations

## mount, volume, tmpfs
