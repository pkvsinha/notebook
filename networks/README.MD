# Computer Networks Guide

At the very basic level, computers are connected using a networking model. They follow a set of protocols to achieve communication between two networking devices(computers).

These protocols are designed to perform various tasks in a networking model, for example to handle failure, errors, addressing computers in a network, create connections, pass messages efficiently etc. Thus a network model comprise of set of protocols. A further categorization enable to see the model divided into several layers, each layer is responsible for a set of work/tasks and provide service to layer above it.

The most commonly used model to understand the network model is the TCP/IP model, a subset of OSI model. This model divides the amount of working done to handle a network communication between two devices into the following layers.

1. Application layer [Session/Presentation].
2. Transport layer:
3. Internet layer:
4. Data Link layer:
5. Physical layer:


Various programs exist in the system to gather information of what is happening at each layer. Example commands are : `ping`, `tracert`, `host`, `hostname`
