Scirpts in general sense means set of steps to be followed to reach an end goal. Scripting in terms computers also means the same, write a set of strps through commands to the computer to reach to an end goal like starting a webserver or simply configuring a web server. So first a command interpreter is requied to perform those steps from the script - in Linux/Unix it is called as Shell, in MS windos it is called as CMD.

Of course, you would want to perform certain operations to get the result. So the action would taken on some entity. In computer, it can either mean - File system, Network etc. A command/program when executed becomes a process. To a process the following abstrations are provided - an environment, a file system, a standard input, a standard output, a networking interface. A shell allows combnining process, configuring the process etc.
