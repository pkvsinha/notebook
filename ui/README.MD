# User interface
---

Developing user interfaces are fun and tricky part of software development. It lies at a layer where it is responsible for displaying meaningful information about the system. A system in general contains a lot of data - operating system, user management system, travel ticket booking system. We store data, lots of data, to make sure system functions the way it is supposed to. A user interface tries to display an information, extracted from that data, relevant to the user. So, between a User(a human) and the system is this interface which display relevant information.

UI technologies are inherently static in nature. Although it allows changes based on certain events. The event model allows developers to make the UI dynamic. Upon certain event, a callback function will run which will allow to execute certain logic, well to change the UI structure.

## Players

Common Operations on UI
`search`, `filter`, `select`, ``

Apart from the list of components below which are used to display the data for suitable use cases, when these components are combined together to form a view of the system, a user can perform certain set of operations, there comes a set of problems. A view represents a state of the system. Both of them should be in sync. Out of various patterns used to solve the problem the most common one is MVVM. This pattern works by separating the concerns of displaying the view and updating the data through a view model layer. For example, Routing that is navigating from one view to another, handling security - authentication and authorization.
