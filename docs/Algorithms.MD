There are varios ways of solving a problem. In certain cases using a data structure will help you write better program, in certain cases thinking about a problem as set of sub-problems will help you analyze and write better software. The algorithms that we write makes the assumption that we are using **_TODO Computing engine which uses RAM and a processor_**.

1. Divide and Conquer -> Dynamic programming -> Greedy
2. Graph algorithms
